name: agent-relay-message
description: Register a coding-agent session with Agent Relay and exchange durable messages by exact slug. Use when the user asks to register a Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode session with the relay; send, read, reply to, or acknowledge relay messages; contact another agent by slug; or coordinate a handoff through Agent Relay instead of tmux.

# Message through Agent Relay

Use the configured `agent_relay` Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. Do not
silently substitute tmux messaging when the relay is unavailable.

## Apply channel-independent message safety

- Address one exact recipient slug and let relay metadata identify the sender;
  do not add a tmux pane prefix to message content.
- Preserve the complete message and use `reply_to_message` to keep response
  routing attached to the received message.
- Distinguish durable server acceptance from recipient processing. A successful
  send means queued; acknowledgement means processed.
- Treat a busy or idle recipient as valid: the durable inbox holds the message
  until that session reads it.
- Do not blindly repeat a send whose result is unknown after a transport timeout;
  the first call may have committed, so retrying can create a duplicate. Report
  the ambiguous outcome and retain the exact content for the user to decide.

The pane-inspection, occupied-composer, bracketed-paste, and empty-composer
checks in `tmux-message` do not apply to the Relay payload call because it
injects no keystrokes. They do apply when a handoff sends a conditional tmux
wake notice.

## Establish this session's slug

- Use the slug assigned by the user or handoff prompt. Never select one active
  slug arbitrarily from `list_sessions` and claim it as this session.
- Call `register_session(slug, agent_kind)` in unauthenticated mode. Registration
  is idempotent, so repeat it when resuming a session or when registration state
  is uncertain.
- Pass the same slug as `acting_slug` on later calls. In authenticated mode,
  omit `acting_slug`; the bearer token establishes the caller.
- If no caller slug is available from the user, prompt, or acknowledged session
  context, ask for one before sending or reading.

## Send

Call `send_message` with the exact `recipient_slug`, this session's
`acting_slug`, and the user's complete message. Preserve the user's words; do
not summarize or truncate them. Treat a successful tool result as durable relay
acceptance, not proof that the recipient processed the message.

Inspect `recipient_waiting_at_send` in every successful `send_message` or
`reply_to_message` result. `true` means the relay observed an active recipient
MCP wait when it notified the recipient; it does not prove processing or later
listener replacement. `false` means the message is durable but no MCP wait was
observed. Outside a handoff with a known tmux recovery address, report the false
observation without inventing another delivery channel.

In a Relay-based handoff, follow the `handoff` skill's conditional wake rule. A
false observation permits one `tmux-message` wake notice containing the Relay
message ID and an instruction to process the Relay inbox and restore exactly
one listener. Never copy the actionable payload into that notice. A true
observation permits no tmux notice.

## Read and acknowledge

Call `read_inbox` with this session's `acting_slug` and handle every returned
message in send order. Acknowledge each message only after completing the action
it requests or presenting its complete content to the user. Do not acknowledge
merely because the inbox call returned it.

When a response belongs to a received message, call `reply_to_message`; the
relay derives the other participant. Use a new `send_message` only for a new
thread or when the user explicitly addresses a different slug.

## Maintain one listener

After registration, call `read_inbox` once and process any pending messages.
Then keep exactly one background listener for this slug:

1. Start one background subagent whose only relay operation is one
   `wait_for_messages` call with this session's identity.
2. Have the child return the complete result without acknowledging anything.
3. When the child finishes, handle every returned message in send order.
4. Acknowledge each message only after its requested work or presentation is
   complete. Use `reply_to_message` when the response belongs to that message.
5. Start one replacement listener after all returned messages are handled.

Do not start a second listener while one is active. Do not poll `read_inbox` or
repeat short waits; the MCP wait remains blocked until a message arrives or the
configured client deadline expires. A listener reports durable delivery, not
completed processing.

Configure Codex's `agent_relay` MCP server with
`tool_timeout_sec = 86400`. If an unchanged Codex wait reaches that 24-hour
client deadline, report the failed operation, caller slug, and timeout, then
start exactly one replacement listener. Do not acknowledge anything because a
timeout delivers no message. A message committed between cancellation and
replacement remains pending and returns when the replacement wait begins. This
once-per-day replacement is recovery from the configured client deadline, not
short-wait polling; any other repeated failure requires diagnosis instead of a
retry loop.

Use the control behavior supported by the current client:

- **Codex:** spawn the listener with `gpt-5.6-luna` and low reasoning when that
  model is available. Keep the parent turn active with the collaboration wait
  until the child completes; repeat the wait if it returns while the child is
  still running. A user prompt may steer the active turn: handle it, then
  continue waiting for the same child. Do not return the parent to an idle
  prompt while its listener is active because Codex 0.147.0 does not start a
  parent turn when an already-detached child later finishes.
- **OpenCode:** require
  `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` in the environment inherited
  by the OpenCode process, then call `task` with `background: true`. Keep the
  session's current model unless the user requests another. Do not use manual
  `Ctrl+B` detachment as the listener mechanism.
- **Claude Code:** use a background subagent and request a cheaper model only
  when the active provider supports that model selection. Its completion may
  return control to the parent when the client supports background completion
  wake-up.

The OpenCode and Claude Code parent may return to the prompt only after the
client has demonstrated that background completion starts the handling turn.
Otherwise use the Codex active-parent pattern. At prompt start and before
reporting completion, read the inbox if listener state is absent or uncertain.

If a relay call fails, report the operation, caller slug, recipient slug when
applicable, and the returned error. Do not claim delivery. An ambiguous send
failure permits neither a tmux payload resend nor a conditional wake notice
because no authoritative `recipient_waiting_at_send` result was returned. A
preflight failure may select the `handoff` skill's announced tmux fallback; an
ordinary Relay operation does not switch channels silently.
